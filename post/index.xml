      <description>With growing up in Wisconsin my whole life, the Green Bay Packers are one of my favorite sports team. I appreciate the history and tradition of the proud franchise that I’ve always supported. It has also helped that the franchise has had a lot of winning seasons and is contending for the Super Bowl almost every year because of the quarterbacks.
Since it’s almost time for the NFL draft this year and the Packers potentially drafted their future quarterback in Jordan Love last year, I decided to take a look at the three Super Bowl winning quarterbacks in franchise history.</description>
