    <div class="article-content">
      <p>My name is Ethan Sertic and I am a student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am from Franklin, Wisconsin near Milwaukee and my major is Sports Media &amp; Communications. Sports have had a huge impact on my life and who I am today. I&rsquo;ve played and watched many different sports and realized that I want to pursue a career involved in the sports field. Throughout my education and work experiences, I have found that I am happiest and perform at my best when I get to talk and watch sports which has led to my interest in sports media. I am continuing to learn new, different things in college and I&rsquo;m excited for what the future holds. Continuing my education is important in order to get ready for the next part of my life after school and finding a job. If I continue to work hard and pursue my dreams, I know I&rsquo;ll be able to find a job in the sports field that I will enjoy.</p>
